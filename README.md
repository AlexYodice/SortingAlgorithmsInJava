# Shoe Sorting Project

This project aims to demonstrate various sorting algorithms implemented in Java to sort an array of shoe sizes. It was developed as part of personal real-life work experience to improve coding skills and understanding of sorting algorithms.

# Introduction

The Shoe Sorting Project showcases different sorting algorithms applied to an array of shoe sizes. Sorting algorithms are an essential concept in computer science and play a crucial role in various applications, including data processing and analysis. This project serves as a learning exercise to explore different sorting techniques and their implementation in Java.

# Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this project:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Radix Sort
7. Bogo Sort (for educational purposes only)

# Getting Started

To run the project locally, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest JDK version from the Oracle website.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
  [ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/AlexYodice/SortingAlgorithmsInJava)
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

3. Run the `SortingProgram` class to execute the sorting algorithms on randomly generated shoe sizes.
