# Shoe Sorting Project

This project had mainly the purpose of demonstrating various kinds of sorting algorithms in Java, the programs purpose was to sort some basic array of shoe sizes. It was developed in part of personal real-life work experience > I was aiming to improve my coding skills and understanding of Java using some sorting algorithms.

# Introduction

The Shoe Sorting Project showcases different sorting algorithms applied to an array of shoe sizes. Sorting algorithms are an essential concept in computer science and play a crucial role in various applications, including data processing and analysis. This project serves as a learning exercise to explore different sorting techniques and their implementation in Java.

# 7 Sorting Algorithms in this Program:

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this project:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Radix Sort
7. Bogo Sort (for educational purposes only)

# Getting Started

To run the project locally, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest JDK version from the Oracle website.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
  [ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/AlexYodice/SortingAlgorithmsInJava)
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

3. Run the `SortingProgram` class to execute the sorting algorithms on randomly generated shoe sizes.
